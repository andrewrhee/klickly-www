More importantly, applications can listen to any kind of change (change, add, remove, reset, sort, destroy) in this hierarchy using standard Backbone events and respond to them. (views can re-render for example). The implementation strives to be tiny (2.2KB), easy-to-understand, light-weight and fast.\r\n\r\nFor features, performance #s, API documentation, tutorials and recipes, please visit :\r\n\r\nhttp://dhruvaray.github.io/backbone-associations/\r\n\r\n",
